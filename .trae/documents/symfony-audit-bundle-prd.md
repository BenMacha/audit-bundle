# Symfony Audit Bundle - Product Requirements Document

## 1. Product Overview
A comprehensive Symfony bundle that automatically tracks and logs all entity changes (insert, update, delete) in your application with a user-friendly web interface for viewing audit logs.

The bundle provides developers and administrators with complete visibility into data modifications, including who made changes, when they occurred, and what the previous values were. It supports role-based access control, API access, and data rollback functionality for enterprise-grade audit requirements.

## 2. Core Features

### 2.1 User Roles
| Role | Registration Method | Core Permissions |
|------|---------------------|------------------|
| Admin | Symfony security configuration | Full access to all audit logs, configuration management, rollback operations |
| Auditor | Role assignment by Admin | Read-only access to audit logs, export capabilities |
| Developer | Role assignment by Admin | Access to specific entity audit logs, API access |
| Regular User | Standard application user | No audit access (configurable per application) |

### 2.2 Feature Module
Our Symfony audit bundle consists of the following main pages:
1. **Audit Dashboard**: overview statistics, recent changes summary, quick filters.
2. **Entity Audit Logs**: detailed audit log listing, advanced filtering, pagination.
3. **Audit Detail View**: complete change details, old vs new values comparison, metadata.
4. **Configuration Management**: entity inclusion/exclusion settings, column filtering options.
5. **Rollback Interface**: data restoration tools, rollback confirmation, batch operations.
6. **API Documentation**: endpoint reference, authentication guide, usage examples.

## 3. Core Process

**Admin Flow:**
1. Admin accesses audit dashboard to view system-wide changes
2. Uses advanced filters to find specific modifications
3. Reviews detailed change information and metadata
4. Configures which entities and columns to audit
5. Performs rollback operations when needed
6. Manages user access and API keys

**Auditor Flow:**
1. Auditor logs into audit interface with read-only permissions
2. Searches and filters audit logs by various criteria
3. Views detailed change information and exports reports
4. Monitors compliance and generates audit reports

**Developer Flow:**
1. Developer accesses API documentation and generates API keys
2. Integrates audit API into applications or monitoring tools
3. Queries audit data programmatically for specific entities
4. Uses webhook notifications for real-time change monitoring
